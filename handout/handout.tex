\section*{Thesis}
Shakespeare takes various artistic liberties within King Henry IV Part 1 to present the royalty in a more positive light than is historically accurate and condemn certain religious groups at the time.  Portraying the royalty positively and condemning Lollardy allowed the play to become more popular, and achieve more theatrical success.
