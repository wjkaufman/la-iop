					<h2><em> King Henry IV Part 1 </em>: An Historical Analysis</h1>
					<h4>LA IOP 2015 <br> Mr. Bursiek</h4>
					<p> <small>Will Kaufman</small> </p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Thesis</h2>
					<p>
						Shakespeare takes various artistic liberties within
						<em> King Henry IV Part 1 </em> to present the royalty
						in a more positive light than is historically accurate and condemn
						certain religious groups at the time.
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">More popular</p></li>
							<li class="fragment">More theatrical success</p></li>
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						King Henry IV is a historical play, so an understanding
						of the actual history (certainly at the time in which it was written)
						is crucial to understanding all of the implications of the changes
						Shakespeare made.  Aligning himself with the royalty and the traditional
						religious structure would benefit him more than accurately portraying
						events.

							Henry seized control from Henry IV's favorite Thomas Arundel,
							Archbishop of Canterbury </li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>

								King Henry IV, friends with Prince Henry </li>

						<h3>Elizabethan Era </h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Shakespeare wrote <em>King Henry IV Part 1</em>
