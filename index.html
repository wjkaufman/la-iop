					<h2><em> King Henry IV Part 1 </em>: An Historical Analysis</h1>
					<h4>LA IOP 2015 <br> Mr. Bursiek</h4>
					<p> <small>Will Kaufman</small> </p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Thesis</h2>
					<p>
						Shakespeare takes various artistic liberties within
						<em> King Henry IV Part 1 </em> to present the royalty
						in a generally positive light and comment on various social and
						religious events at the time.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						King Henry IV is a historical play, so an understanding
						of the actual history (certainly at the time in which it was written)
						is crucial to understanding the play as a whole

						<h3>Elizabethan Era </h3>
						<ul>
